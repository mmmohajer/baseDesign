Hi Marouane,
I reviewd your codes and really love your progress in coding. 
I merged most of your codes with some minor modifications to master.

I have a few comments, I want you to work on them:
1. For slider cards, after we reach the the most right item 
(last item from the right), when we click on the right arrow, it should 
show the first item again (This loop must be continuous).
The same situation must happen for the most left item (first item). After,
reaching to the first item, if user clicks on the left arrow, we should
see the last item.

2. For the card component, I really liked what you did. But I want you to
design several different types of cards. If we can have different options,
in the future, we will be able to select which design is better depending
on project. Please keep up your researching on more cards and any of them
that has beautiful style, please try to add them as a sub component to your
cards component.

3. I see that you are getting the habit of using our css classes and it is
very good. I want you to know that our css classes are really flexible and
still some your css codes that I looked at them can be written by our pre-defined
css classes instead of defining them in the css file.

Overall, your work looks very good to me and you made me really happy with
what you did.

Thank you
