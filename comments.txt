Here my comments are listed for your first push to Github:

1. I changed the name of the branch to "feature/createNavbar", 
please make sure to apply this change in your local as well.

2. For, every components that you are going to build, put it
inside a folder. The folder includes the scss file, index.js 
and component.js (EX: Nav.js); look at how I structured my
folders for App and Nav components.

3. I changed the name of component from Navbare to Nav

4. You pushed a folder named .idea, I do not know what 
that folder is and I believe we do not need that to be pushed
in the github. If this is something in your local machine, 
please make sure to add the name of this folder into 
.gitignore file.

Thanks,
Mohammad

Here my comments are listed for your second push to Github:
1. Please review my code, and see how I structured the folders;
For common css classes like .flex, I am using the main style folder.
But for specific css classes like .nav, I am using the css modular way

2. Usually, we use 3 or 4 different colors in our website. So,
I am defining theses colors in the variables.scss file, and I
will import these variables to other scss files that can be used.

3. The same situation can happen for font family and font colors, and font sizes.

4. For responsive design, it is much better to use our completely 
flexible css classes and pre-defined mixins. By time, you will learn
how to use them, just review my code and try to understand, how
I structured everything.

5. For importing files, I am using webpack aliases;
please look at how I import files from other components.

Thanks,
Mohammad
