Here my comments are listed for your first push to Github:

1. I changed the name of the branch to "feature/createNavbar", 
please make sure to apply this change in your local as well.

2. For, every components that you are going to build, put it
inside a folder. The folder includes the scss file, index.js 
and component.js (EX: Nav.js); look at how I structured my
folders for App and Nav components.

3. I changed the name of component from Navbare to Nav

4. You pushed a folder named .idea, I do not know what 
that folder is and I believe we do not need that to be pushed
in the github. If this is something in your local machine, 
please make sure to add the name of this folder into 
.gitignore file.

Thanks,
Mohammad
